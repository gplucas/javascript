<h1>JavaScript first steps</h1>
<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
<p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser. When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
<p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface.</p>
<div class="info">Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify.</div>

<h3>A first splash into JavaScript</h3>
<p>Thinking like a programmer - One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.</p>
<p>This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it.</p>
<li><strong>Functions</strong></li>
<p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword function, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that we put two curly braces ({ }). Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.</p>
<p>When we want to run the code, we type the name of the function followed by the parentheses.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/wUAfkD7k"></script>
<li><strong>Operators</strong></li>
<p>JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.</p>
<li><strong>Conditionals</strong></li>
<p>A conditional code block allows you to run code selectively, depending on whether a certain condition is true or not. It looks a bit like a function, but it isn't. The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword if, then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses we include a test. If the test returns true, we run the code inside the curly braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/taWiHANv"></script>
<li><strong>Events</strong></li>
<p>Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.</p>
<li><strong>Loops</strong></li>
<p>Loops are a very important concept in programming, which allow you to keep running a piece of code over and over again, until a certain condition is met.</p>

<h3>What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript</h3>
<p><strong>Types of error</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>
<p>Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!</p>
<p>Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.</p>
<div class="info">Note: console.log() is a really useful debugging function that prints a value to the console. So it will print the value of something to the console as soon as we have tried to set it in line x.</div>
<hr>
<h3>Storing the information you need — Variables</h3>
<p><strong>What is a Variable</strong></p>
<p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.</p>
<div class="info">Note: We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.</div>
<p><strong>Declaring a Variable</strong></p>
<p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword var or let followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/9CTgipPc"></script>
<p>Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge.</p>
<p><strong>Initializing a variable</strong></p>
<p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/d62MBWTt"></script>
<p>You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/BTzE2VGW"></script>
<p>This is probably what you'll do most of the time, as it is quicker than doing the two actions on two separate lines.</p>
<p><strong>The difference between var and let</strong></p>
<p>The reasons are somewhat historical. Back when JavaScript was first created, there was only var. This works basically fine in most cases, but it has some issues in the way it works — its design can sometimes be confusing or downright annoying. So, let was created in modern versions of JavaScript, a new keyword for creating variables that works somewhat differently to var, fixing its issues in the process.</p>
<p>(...) we recommend that you use let as much as possible in your code, rather than var. There is no reason to use var, unless you need to support old versions of Internet Explorer with your code (it doesn't support let until version 11; the modern Microsoft Edge browser supports let just fine).</p>
<p><strong>An aside on variable naming rules</strong></p>
<p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>
<p>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international audience.</p>
<p>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific things, so may get confusing.</p>
<p>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.</p>
<p>A safe convention to stick to is so-called "lower camel case", where you stick together multiple words, using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words.</p>
<p>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big long phrases.</p>
<p>Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable from myAge.</p>
<p>One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like var, function, let, and for as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/L6SwXHnv"></script>
<p><strong>Variable types</strong></p>
<p><strong>Numbers</strong></p>
<p>You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/zRfZQg97"></script>
<p><strong>Strings</strong></p>
<p>Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript tries to interpret it as another variable name.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/eeBaJm2x"></script>
<p><strong>Booleans</strong></p>
<p>Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, true or false. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/ikX8zNKu"></script>
<p><strong>Arrays</strong></p>
<p>An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/bgi81SMp"></script>
<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
<p>In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/RZjWeAz7"></script>
<p><strong>Constants in JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>Many programming languages have the concept of a constant — a value that once declared can't be changed. There are many reasons why you'd want to do this, from security (if a third party script changed such values it could cause problems) to debugging and code comprehension (it is harder to accidentally change values that shouldn't be changed and mess things up).</p>
<p>In the early days of JavaScript, constants didn't exist. In modern JavaScript, we have the keyword const, which lets us store values that can never be changed:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/V0SZp0AA"></script>
<p>const works in exactly the same way as let, except that you can't give a const a new value.</p>

<h3>Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators</h3>
<strong>Types of numbers</strong>
<p>In programming, even the humble decimal number system that we all know so well is more complicated than you might think. We use different terms to describe different types of decimal numbers, for example:</p>
<li><strong>Integers</strong> are floating-point numbers without a fraction. They can either be positive or negative, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.</li>
<li><strong>Floating point numbers (floats)</strong> have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.</li>
<li><strong>Doubles</strong> are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).</li>
<p>We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also have things like:</p>
<li><strong>Binary</strong> — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.</li>
<li><strong>Octal</strong> — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.</li>
<li><strong>Hexadecimal</strong> — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting colors in CSS.</li>
<p><strong>Operator precedence</strong></p>
<p>Some operators are applied before others when calculating the result of a calculation (referred to as an expression, in programming).  Operator precedence in JavaScript is the same as is taught in math classes in school — Multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract (the calculation is always evaluated from left to right).</p>
<p>If you want to override operator precedence, you can put parentheses round the parts that you want to be explicitly dealt with first.</p>
<p><strong>Increment and decrement operators</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you'll want to repeatedly add or subtract one to or from a numeric variable value. This can be conveniently done using the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. We used ++ in our "Guess the number" game back in our first splash into JavaScript article, when we added 1 to our guessCount variable to keep track of how many guesses the user has left after each turn.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment operators</strong></p>
<p>Assignment operators are operators that assign a value to a variable. We have already used the most basic one, =, loads of times — it assigns the variable on the left the value stated on the right:</p>
<p><strong>Comparison operators</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we will want to run true/false tests, then act accordingly depending on the result of that test — to do this we use comparison operators.</p>

<h3>Useful string methods</h3>

<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p><strong>What is an array?</strong></p>
<p>Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an array, and we want to loop through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the prices together and printing out the total price at the bottom.</p>
<p>If we didn't have arrays, we'd have to store every item in a separate variable, then call the code that does the printing and adding separately for each item. This would be much longer to write out, less efficient, and more error-prone. If we had 10 items to add to the invoice it would already be annoying, but what about 100 items, or 1000?</p>
<p><strong>Creating arrays</strong></p>
<p>Arrays consist of square brackets and elements that are separated by commas.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/qANzMU1y"></script>
<p>In the above example, each element is a string, but in an array we can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings.</p>

<h3>Making decisions in your code — conditionals</h3>
<p>In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime.</p>
<p><strong>if...else statements</strong></p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/s6JM7nVW"></script>
<p><strong>switch statements</strong></p>
<p>if...else statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be run, and/or the conditions are complex (for example, multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.</p>
<p>In such a case, switch statements are your friend — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through a number of choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/CgfkX7cJ"></script>
<p><strong>Ternary operator</strong></p>
<p>The ternary or conditional operator is a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it is true, and another if it is false — this can be useful in some situations, and can take up a lot less code than an if...else block if you have two choices that are chosen between via a true/false condition.</p>
