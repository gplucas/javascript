<h1>JavaScript first steps</h1>
<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
<p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser. When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
<p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface.</p>
<div class="info">Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify.</div>
<hr>
<h3>A first splash into JavaScript</h3>
<p>Thinking like a programmer - One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.</p>
<p>This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it.</p>
<li><strong>Functions</strong></li>
<p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword function, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that we put two curly braces ({ }). Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.</p>
<p>When we want to run the code, we type the name of the function followed by the parentheses.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/wUAfkD7k"></script>
<li><strong>Operators</strong></li>
<p>JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.</p>
<li><strong>Conditionals</strong></li>
<p>A conditional code block allows you to run code selectively, depending on whether a certain condition is true or not. It looks a bit like a function, but it isn't. The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword if, then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses we include a test. If the test returns true, we run the code inside the curly braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/taWiHANv"></script>
<li><strong>Events</strong></li>
<p>Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.</p>
<li><strong>Loops</strong></li>
<p>Loops are a very important concept in programming, which allow you to keep running a piece of code over and over again, until a certain condition is met.</p>
<hr>
<h3>What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript</h3>
<p><strong>Types of error</strong></p>
<p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>
<p>Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!</p>
<p>Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.</p>
<div class="info">Note: console.log() is a really useful debugging function that prints a value to the console. So it will print the value of something to the console as soon as we have tried to set it in line x.</div>
<hr>
<h3>Storing the information you need — Variables</h3>
<p><strong>What is a Variable</strong></p>
<p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence.</p>
<div class="info">Note: We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.</div>
<p><strong>Declaring a Variable</strong></p>
<p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword var or let followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/9CTgipPc"></script>
<p>Here we're creating two variables called myName and myAge.</p>
<p><strong>Initializing a variable</strong></p>
<p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (=), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/d62MBWTt"></script>
<p>You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/BTzE2VGW"></script>
<p>This is probably what you'll do most of the time, as it is quicker than doing the two actions on two separate lines.</p>
<p><strong>The difference between var and let</strong></p>
<p>The reasons are somewhat historical. Back when JavaScript was first created, there was only var. This works basically fine in most cases, but it has some issues in the way it works — its design can sometimes be confusing or downright annoying. So, let was created in modern versions of JavaScript, a new keyword for creating variables that works somewhat differently to var, fixing its issues in the process.</p>
<p>(...) we recommend that you use let as much as possible in your code, rather than var. There is no reason to use var, unless you need to support old versions of Internet Explorer with your code (it doesn't support let until version 11; the modern Microsoft Edge browser supports let just fine).</p>
<p><strong>An aside on variable naming rules</strong></p>
<p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>
<p>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international audience.</p>
<p>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific things, so may get confusing.</p>
<p>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.</p>
<p>A safe convention to stick to is so-called "lower camel case", where you stick together multiple words, using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words.</p>
<p>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big long phrases.</p>
<p>Variables are case sensitive — so myage is a different variable from myAge.</p>
<p>One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like var, function, let, and for as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/L6SwXHnv"></script>
<p><strong>Variable types</strong></p>
<p><strong>Numbers</strong></p>
<p>You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/zRfZQg97"></script>
<p><strong>Strings</strong></p>
<p>Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript tries to interpret it as another variable name.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/eeBaJm2x"></script>
<p><strong>Booleans</strong></p>
<p>Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, true or false. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/ikX8zNKu"></script>
<p><strong>Arrays</strong></p>
<p>An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/bgi81SMp"></script>
<p><strong>Objects</strong></p>
<p>In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/RZjWeAz7"></script>
<p><strong>Constants in JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>Many programming languages have the concept of a constant — a value that once declared can't be changed. There are many reasons why you'd want to do this, from security (if a third party script changed such values it could cause problems) to debugging and code comprehension (it is harder to accidentally change values that shouldn't be changed and mess things up).</p>
<p>In the early days of JavaScript, constants didn't exist. In modern JavaScript, we have the keyword const, which lets us store values that can never be changed:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/V0SZp0AA"></script>
<p>const works in exactly the same way as let, except that you can't give a const a new value.</p>

<h3>Basic math in JavaScript — numbers and operators</h3>
<strong>Types of numbers</strong>
<p>In programming, even the humble decimal number system that we all know so well is more complicated than you might think. We use different terms to describe different types of decimal numbers, for example:</p>
<li><strong>Integers</strong> are floating-point numbers without a fraction. They can either be positive or negative, e.g. 10, 400, or -5.</li>
<li><strong>Floating point numbers (floats)</strong> have decimal points and decimal places, for example 12.5, and 56.7786543.</li>
<li><strong>Doubles</strong> are a specific type of floating point number that have greater precision than standard floating point numbers (meaning that they are accurate to a greater number of decimal places).</li>
<p>We even have different types of number systems! Decimal is base 10 (meaning it uses 0–9 in each column), but we also have things like:</p>
<li><strong>Binary</strong> — The lowest level language of computers; 0s and 1s.</li>
<li><strong>Octal</strong> — Base 8, uses 0–7 in each column.</li>
<li><strong>Hexadecimal</strong> — Base 16, uses 0–9 and then a–f in each column. You may have encountered these numbers before when setting colors in CSS.</li>
<p><strong>Operator precedence</strong></p>
<p>Some operators are applied before others when calculating the result of a calculation (referred to as an expression, in programming).  Operator precedence in JavaScript is the same as is taught in math classes in school — Multiply and divide are always done first, then add and subtract (the calculation is always evaluated from left to right).</p>
<p>If you want to override operator precedence, you can put parentheses round the parts that you want to be explicitly dealt with first.</p>
<p><strong>Increment and decrement operators</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you'll want to repeatedly add or subtract one to or from a numeric variable value. This can be conveniently done using the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. We used ++ in our "Guess the number" game back in our first splash into JavaScript article, when we added 1 to our guessCount variable to keep track of how many guesses the user has left after each turn.</p>
<p><strong>Assignment operators</strong></p>
<p>Assignment operators are operators that assign a value to a variable. We have already used the most basic one, =, loads of times — it assigns the variable on the left the value stated on the right:</p>
<p><strong>Comparison operators</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we will want to run true/false tests, then act accordingly depending on the result of that test — to do this we use comparison operators.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Handling text — strings in JavaScript</h3>
<p>Nothing to see here.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Useful string methods</h3>
<p>Nothing to see here.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Arrays</h3>
<p><strong>What is an array?</strong></p>
<p>Arrays are generally described as "list-like objects"; they are basically single objects that contain multiple values stored in a list. Array objects can be stored in variables and dealt with in much the same way as any other type of value, the difference being that we can access each value inside the list individually, and do super useful and efficient things with the list, like loop through it and do the same thing to every value. Maybe we've got a series of product items and their prices stored in an array, and we want to loop through them all and print them out on an invoice, while totaling all the prices together and printing out the total price at the bottom.</p>
<p>If we didn't have arrays, we'd have to store every item in a separate variable, then call the code that does the printing and adding separately for each item. This would be much longer to write out, less efficient, and more error-prone. If we had 10 items to add to the invoice it would already be annoying, but what about 100 items, or 1000?</p>
<p><strong>Creating arrays</strong></p>
<p>Arrays consist of square brackets and elements that are separated by commas.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/qANzMU1y"></script>
<p>In the above example, each element is a string, but in an array we can store various data types — strings, numbers, objects, and even other arrays. We can also mix data types in a single array — we do not have to limit ourselves to storing only numbers in one array, and in another only strings.</p>

<h1>JavaScript building blocks</h1>
<h3>Making decisions in your code — conditionals</h3>
<p>In any programming language, the code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. For example, in a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over. In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime.</p>
<p><strong>if...else statements</strong></p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/s6JM7nVW"></script>
<p><strong>switch statements</strong></p>
<p>if...else statements do the job of enabling conditional code well, but they are not without their downsides. They are mainly good for cases where you've got a couple of choices, and each one requires a reasonable amount of code to be run, and/or the conditions are complex (for example, multiple logical operators). For cases where you just want to set a variable to a certain choice of value or print out a particular statement depending on a condition, the syntax can be a bit cumbersome, especially if you've got a large number of choices.</p>
<p>In such a case, switch statements are your friend — they take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through a number of choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it. Here's some more pseudocode, to give you an idea:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/CgfkX7cJ"></script>
<p><strong>Ternary operator</strong></p>
<p>The ternary or conditional operator is a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it is true, and another if it is false — this can be useful in some situations, and can take up a lot less code than an if...else block if you have two choices that are chosen between via a true/false condition.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/m3pi5MAq"></script>
<hr>
<h3>Looping code</h3>
<p>Programming languages are very useful for rapidly completing repetitive tasks, from multiple basic calculations to just about any other situation where you've got a lot of similar items of work to complete.</p>
<p>Programming loops are all to do with doing the same thing over and over again, which is termed iteration in programming speak.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/fXFcMhTF"></script>
<p><strong>The standard for loop</strong></p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/34UNcppK"></script>
<div class="info">We would recommend for, at least to begin with, as it is probably the easiest for remembering everything — the initializer, condition, and final-expression all have to go neatly into the parentheses, so it is easy to see where they are and check that you aren't missing them.</div>
<div class="info">Warning: With for — as with all loops — you must make sure that the initializer is incremented or, depending on the case, decremented, so that it eventually reaches the point where the condition is not true. If not, the loop will go on forever, and either the browser will force it to stop, or it will crash. This is called an infinite loop.</div>
<p>for is not the only type of loop available in JavaScript. There are actually many others and, while you don't need to understand all of these now, it is worth having a look at the structure of a couple of others so that you can recognize the same features at work in a slightly different way.</p>
<p><strong>while loop</strong></p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/7Pp9MRHh"></script>
<p>The <strong>do...while loop</strong> is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/RePrrLrb"></script>
<p>The differentiator here is that the condition comes after everything else, wrapped in parentheses and preceded by a while keyword. In a do...while loop, the code inside the curly braces is always run once before the check is made to see if it should be executed again (in while and for, the check comes first, so the code might never be executed).</p>
<div class="info">Warning: With while and do...while — as with all loops — you must make sure that the initializer is incremented or, depending on the case, decremented, so the condition eventually becomes false. If not, the loop will go on forever, and either the browser will force it to stop, or it will crash. This is called an infinite loop.</div>
<p><strong>Which loop type should you use?</strong></p>
<p>For basic uses, for, while, and do...while loops are largely interchangeable. They can all be used to solve the same problems, and which one you use will largely depend on your personal preference — which one you find easiest to remember or most intuitive.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Functions — reusable blocks of code</h3>
<p>Another essential concept in coding is functions, which allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times.</p>
<p>Pretty much anytime you make use of a JavaScript structure that features a pair of parentheses — () — and you're not using a common built-in language structure like a for loop, while or do...while loop, or if...else statement, you are making use of a function.</p>
<p>The JavaScript language has many built-in functions to allow you to do useful things without having to write all that code yourself. In fact, some of the code you are calling when you invoke (a fancy word for run, or execute) a built in browser function couldn't be written in JavaScript — many of these functions are calling parts of the background browser code, which is written largely in low-level system languages like C++, not web languages like JavaScript.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that some built-in browser functions are not part of the core JavaScript language — some are defined as part of browser APIs, which build on top of the default language to provide even more functionality.</p>
<p><strong>Invoking functions</strong></p>
<p>To actually use a function after it has been defined, you've got to run — or invoke — it. This is done by including the name of the function in the code somewhere, followed by parentheses.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/BW2m75C5"></script>
<div class="info">Note: This form of creating a function is also known as function declaration. It is always hoisted, so you can call function above function definition and it will work fine.</div>
<p><strong>Function parameters</strong></p>
<p>Some functions require parameters to be specified when you are invoking them — these are values that need to be included inside the function parentheses, which it needs to do its job properly.</p>
<div class="info">Note: Parameters are sometimes called arguments, properties, or even attributes.</div>
<p><strong>Function scope and conflicts</strong></p>
<p>Let's talk a bit about scope — a very important concept when dealing with functions. When you create a function, the variables and other things defined inside the function are inside their own separate scope, meaning that they are locked away in their own separate compartments, unreachable from code outside the functions.</p>
<p>The top level outside all your functions is called the global scope. Values defined in the global scope are accessible from everywhere in the code.</p>
<p>JavaScript is set up like this for various reasons — but mainly because of security and organization. Sometimes you don't want variables to be accessible from everywhere in the code — external scripts that you call in from elsewhere could start to mess with your code and cause problems because they happen to be using the same variable names as other parts of the code, causing conflicts. This might be done maliciously, or just by accident.</p>
<p>For example, say you have an HTML file that is calling in two external JavaScript files, and both of them have a variable and a function defined that use the same name.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Build your own function</h3>
<p><strong>The basic function</strong></p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/pvMnf4dc"></script>
<p>We start off with the keyword function, which means we are defining a function. This is followed by the name we want to give to our function, a set of parentheses, and a set of curly braces. Any parameters we want to give to our function go inside the parentheses, and the code that runs when we call the function goes inside the curly braces.</p>
<p><strong>Calling the function</strong></p>

<p>This line invokes the function, making it run immediately. When you save your code and reload it in the browser, you'll see.</p>

<h3>Function return values</h3>
<p><strong>What are return values?</strong></p>
<p>Return values are just what they sound like —  the values that a function returns when it has completed.</p>
<p>Generally, a return value is used where the function is an intermediate step in a calculation of some kind. You want to get to a final result, which involves some values that need to be calculated by a function. After the function calculates the value, it can return the result so it can be stored in a variable; and you can use this variable in the next stage of the calculation.</p>
<p><strong>Some extra function related tips:</strong></p>
<p>Look at another example of writing error handling into functions. It is generally a good idea to check that any necessary parameters are validated, and that any optional parameters have some kind of default value provided. This way, your program will be less likely to throw errors.</p>
<p>Think about the idea of creating a function library. As you go further into your programming career, you'll start doing the same kinds of things over and over again. It is a good idea to create your own library of utility functions to do these sorts of things. You can copy them over to new code, or even just apply it to HTML pages wherever you need it.</p>

<h3>Introduction to events</h3>
<p>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example, if the user selects a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box.</p>
<p><strong>A series of fortunate events</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned above, events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming — the system produces (or "fires") a signal of some kind when an event occurs, and provides a mechanism by which an action can be automatically taken (that is, some code running) when the event occurs. For example, in an airport, when the runway is clear for take off, a signal is communicated to the pilot. As a result, the plane can safely takeoff.</p>
<p>In the case of the Web, events are fired inside the browser window, and tend to be attached to a specific item that resides in it — this might be a single element, set of elements, the HTML document loaded in the current tab, or the entire browser window. There are many different types of events that can occur. For example:</p>
<li>The user selects a certain element or hovers the cursor over a certain element.</li>
<li>The user chooses a key on the keyboard.</li>
<li>The user resizes or closes the browser window.</li>
<li>A web page finishes loading.</li>
<li>A form is submitted.</li>
<li>A video is played, paused, or finishes.</li>
<li>An error occurs.</li>
<p><div class="info">Each available event has an event handler, which is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event, we say we are registering an event handler. Note: Event handlers are sometimes called event listeners — they are pretty much interchangeable for our purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together. The listener listens out for the event happening, and the handler is the code that is run in response to it happening.</div></p>
<div class="info">Note: Web events are not part of the core JavaScript language — they are defined as part of the APIs built into the browser.</div>
<p><strong>What mechanism should I use?</strong></p>
<p>There are only two methods you should consider for handling events:</p>
<li>Event handler properties have less power and options, but are easier to use. So as you begin learning, you might want to start with these.</li>
<li>addEventListener() is more complex, but also more powerful. So after you’ve begun learning, you should try to use it where possible.</li>

<h1>Introducing JavaScript objects</h1>
<h3>JavaScript object basics</h3>
<p><strong>Object basics</strong></p>
<p>An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality (which usually consists of several variables and functions — which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects.)</p>
<p>As with many things in JavaScript, creating an object often begins with defining and initializing a variable.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/fAm4xRj3"></script>
<p>The value of an object member can be pretty much anything — in our person object (example from website explanation) we've got a string, a number, two arrays, and two functions. The first four items are data items, and are referred to as the object's properties.</p>
<p>An object like this is referred to as an object literal — we've literally written out the object contents as we've come to create it.</p>
<p>It is very common to create an object using an object literal when you want to transfer a series of structured, related data items in some manner, for example sending a request to the server to be put into a database. Sending a single object is much more efficient than sending several items individually, and it is easier to work with than an array, when you want to identify individual items by name.</p>
<div class="info">Note: It is useful to think about the way objects communicate as message passing — when an object needs another object to perform some kind of action often it sends a message to another object via one of its methods, and waits for a response, which we know as a return value.</div>

<h3>Object-oriented JavaScript for beginners</h3>
<p><strong>Object-oriented programming — the basics</strong></p>
<p>To start with, let's give you a simplistic, high-level view of what Object-oriented programming (OOP) is. We say simplistic, because OOP can quickly get very complicated, and giving it a full treatment now would probably confuse more than help. The basic idea of OOP is that we use objects to model real world things that we want to represent inside our programs, and/or provide a simple way to access functionality that would otherwise be hard or impossible to make use of.</p>
<p>Objects can contain related data and code, which represent information about the thing you are trying to model, and functionality or behavior that you want it to have. Object data (and often, functions too) can be stored neatly (the official word is encapsulated) inside an object package (which can be given a specific name to refer to, which is sometimes called a namespace), making it easy to structure and access; objects are also commonly used as data stores that can be easily sent across the network.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Object prototypes</h3>
<p><strong>A prototype-based language?</strong></p>
<p>JavaScript is often described as a prototype-based language — to provide inheritance, objects can have a prototype object, which acts as a template object that it inherits methods and properties from.</p>
<p>An object's prototype object may also have a prototype object, which it inherits methods and properties from, and so on. This is often referred to as a prototype chain, and explains why different objects have properties and methods defined on other objects available to them.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, a link is made between the object instance and its prototype (its __proto__ property, which is derived from the prototype property on the constructor), and the properties and methods are found by walking up the chain of prototypes.</p>
<div class="info">Warning: The prototype property is one of the most confusingly-named parts of JavaScript — you might think that it points to the prototype object of the current object, but it doesn't (that's an internal object that can be accessed by __proto__, remember?). prototype instead is a property containing an object on which you define members that you want to be inherited.</div>
<hr>
<h3>Inheritance in JavaScript</h3>
<p><strong>When would you use inheritance in JavaScript?</strong></p>
<p>Particularly after this last article, you might be thinking "woo, this is complicated". Well, you are right. Prototypes and inheritance represent some of the most complex aspects of JavaScript, but a lot of JavaScript's power and flexibility comes from its object structure and inheritance, and it is worth understanding how it works.</p>
<p>In a way, you use inheritance all the time. Whenever you use various features of a Web API , or methods/properties defined on a built-in browser object that you call on your strings, arrays, etc., you are implicitly using inheritance.</p>
<p>In terms of using inheritance in your own code, you probably won't use it often, especially to begin with, and in small projects. It is a waste of time to use objects and inheritance just for the sake of it when you don't need them. But as your code bases get larger, you are more likely to find a need for it. If you find yourself starting to create a number of objects that have similar features, then creating a generic object type to contain all the shared functionality and inheriting those features in more specialized object types can be convenient and useful.</p>
<div class="info">Note: Because of the way JavaScript works, with the prototype chain, etc., the sharing of functionality between objects is often called delegation. Specialized objects delegate functionality to a generic object type.</div>
<p>When using inheritance, you are advised to not have too many levels of inheritance, and to keep careful track of where you define your methods and properties. It is possible to start writing code that temporarily modifies the prototypes of built-in browser objects, but you should not do this unless you have a really good reason. Too much inheritance can lead to endless confusion, and endless pain when you try to debug such code.</p>
<p>Ultimately, objects are just another form of code reuse, like functions or loops, with their own specific roles and advantages. If you find yourself creating a bunch of related variables and functions and want to track them all together and package them neatly, an object is a good idea. Objects are also very useful when you want to pass a collection of data from one place to another. Both of these things can be achieved without use of constructors or inheritance. If you only need a single instance of an object, then you are probably better off just using an object literal, and you certainly don't need inheritance.</p>

<h3>Working with JSON</h3>
<p>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is a standard text-based format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. It is commonly used for transmitting data in web applications (e.g., sending some data from the server to the client, so it can be displayed on a web page, or vice versa). You'll come across it quite often, so in this article we give you all you need to work with JSON using JavaScript, including parsing JSON so you can access data within it, and creating JSON.</p>
<p><strong>JSON structure</strong></p>
<p>As described above, JSON is a string whose format very much resembles JavaScript object literal format. You can include the same basic data types inside JSON as you can in a standard JavaScript object — strings, numbers, arrays, booleans, and other object literals. This allows you to construct a data hierarchy, like so:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/n2Q1bHBG"></script>
<p><strong>Other notes</strong></p>
<li>JSON is purely a string with a specified data format — it contains only properties, no methods.</li>
<li>JSON requires double quotes to be used around strings and property names. Single quotes are not valid other than surrounding the entire JSON string.</li>
<li>Even a single misplaced comma or colon can cause a JSON file to go wrong, and not work. You should be careful to validate any data you are attempting to use (although computer-generated JSON is less likely to include errors, as long as the generator program is working correctly). You can validate JSON using an application like JSONLint.</li>
<li>JSON can actually take the form of any data type that is valid for inclusion inside JSON, not just arrays or objects. So for example, a single string or number would be valid JSON.</li>
<li>Unlike in JavaScript code in which object properties may be unquoted, in JSON only quoted strings may be used as properties.</li>

<h3>Object building practice</h3>
<p>Nothing to see here.</p>

<h1>Asynchronous JavaScript</h1>
<h3>General asynchronous programming concepts</h3>
<p><strong>Asynchronous?</strong></p>
<p>Normally, a given program's code runs straight along, with only one thing happening at once. If a function relies on the result of another function, it has to wait for the other function to finish and return, and until that happens, the entire program is essentially stopped from the perspective of the user.
Mac users, for example, sometimes experience this as the spinning rainbow-colored cursor (or "beachball" as it is often called). This cursor is how the operating system says "the current program you're using has had to stop and wait for something to finish up, and it's taking so long that I was worried you'd wonder what was going on."</p>
<p>This is a frustrating experience and isn't a good use of computer processing power — especially in an era in which computers have multiple processor cores available. There's no sense sitting there waiting for something when you could let the other task chug along on another processor core and let you know when it's done. This lets you get other work done in the meantime, which is the basis of asynchronous programming. It is up to the programming environment you are using (web browsers, in the case of web development) to provide you with APIs that allow you to run such tasks asynchronously.</p>
<p><strong>Blocking code</strong></p>
<p>Asynchronous techniques are very useful, particularly in web programming. When a web app runs in a browser and it executes an intensive chunk of code without returning control to the browser, the browser can appear to be frozen. This is called blocking; the browser is blocked from continuing to handle user input and perform other tasks until the web app returns control of the processor.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Introducing asynchronous JavaScript</h3>
<p><strong>Asynchronous JavaScript</strong></p>
<p>Many Web API features now use asynchronous code to run, especially those that access or fetch some kind of resource from an external device, such as fetching a file from the network, accessing a database and returning data from it, accessing a video stream from a web cam, or broadcasting the display to a VR headset.</p>
<p>Why is this difficult to get to work using asynchronous code? Let's look at a quick example. When you fetch an image from a server, you can't return the result immediately. That means that the following (pseudocode) wouldn't work:</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/UU6Qb8aV"></script>
<p>That's because you don't know how long the image will take to download, so when you come to run the second line it will throw an error (possibly intermittently, possibly every time) because the response is not yet available. Instead, you need your code to wait until the response is returned before it tries to do anything else to it.</p>
<p>There are two main types of asynchronous code style you'll come across in JavaScript code, old-style callbacks and newer promise-style code.</p>
<p><strong>Async callbacks</strong></p>
<p>Async callbacks are functions that are specified as arguments when calling a function which will start executing code in the background. When the background code finishes running, it calls the callback function to let you know the work is done, or to let you know that something of interest has happened. Using callbacks is slightly old-fashioned now, but you'll still see them in use in a number of older-but-still-commonly-used APIs.</p>
<p><strong>Promises</strong></p>
<p>Promises are the new style of async code that you'll see used in modern Web APIs. A good example is the fetch() API, which is basically like a modern, more efficient version of XMLHttpRequest.</p>

<h3>Cooperative asynchronous JavaScript: Timeouts and intervals</h3>
<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
<p>For a long time, the web platform has offered JavaScript programmers a number of functions that allow them to asynchronously execute code after a certain time interval has elapsed, and to repeatedly execute a block of code asynchronously until you tell it to stop.</p>
<p><strong>setTimeout()</strong> executes a particular block of code once after a specified time has elapsed.</p>
<p>In the following example, the browser will wait two seconds before executing the anonymous function, then will display the alert message.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/Z0NS9Rtp"></script>
<p><strong>setInterval()</strong></p>
<p>setTimeout() works perfectly when you need to run code once after a set period of time. But what happens when you need to run the code over and over again—for example, in the case of an animation?</p>
<p>This is where setInterval() comes in. This works in a very similar way to setTimeout(), except that the function you pass as the first parameter is executed repeatedly at no less than the number of milliseconds given by the second parameter apart, rather than once. You can also pass any parameters required by the function being executed as subsequent parameters of the setInterval() call.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example. The following function creates a new Date() object, extracts a time string out of it using toLocaleTimeString(), and then displays it in the UI. It then runs the function once per second using setInterval(), creating the effect of a digital clock that updates once per second.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/Fnqz7PRg"></script>
<p><strong>Clearing intervals</strong></p>
<p>setInterval() keeps running a task forever, unless you do something about it. You'll probably want a way to stop such tasks, otherwise you may end up getting errors when the browser can't complete any further versions of the task, or if the animation being handled by the task has finished. You can do this the same way you stop timeouts — by passing the identifier returned by the setInterval() call to the clearInterval() function:</p>
