<h1>JavaScript first steps</h1>
<h3>What is JavaScript?</h3>
<p>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.</p>
<p>Let's briefly recap the story of what happens when you load a web page in a browser. When you load a web page in your browser, you are running your code (the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) inside an execution environment (the browser tab). This is like a factory that takes in raw materials (the code) and outputs a product (the web page).</p>
<p>A very common use of JavaScript is to dynamically modify HTML and CSS to update a user interface.</p>
<div class="info">Note that the code in your web documents is generally loaded and executed in the order it appears on the page. Errors may occur if JavaScript is loaded and run before the HTML and CSS that it is intended to modify.</div>

<h3>A first splash into JavaScript</h3>

<p>Thinking like a programmer - One of the hardest things to learn in programming is not the syntax you need to learn, but how to apply it to solve real world problems. You need to start thinking like a programmer — this generally involves looking at descriptions of what your program needs to do, working out what code features are needed to achieve those things, and how to make them work together.</p>
<p>This requires a mixture of hard work, experience with the programming syntax, and practice — plus a bit of creativity. The more you code, the better you'll get at it.</p>
<li>Functions</li>
<p>Functions are reusable blocks of code that you can write once and run again and again, saving the need to keep repeating code all the time. This is really useful. There are a number of ways to define functions, but for now we'll concentrate on one simple type. Here we have defined a function by using the keyword function, followed by a name, with parentheses put after it. After that we put two curly braces ({ }). Inside the curly braces goes all the code that we want to run whenever we call the function.</p>
<p>When we want to run the code, we type the name of the function followed by the parentheses.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/m1qr6710"></script>
<li>Operators</li>
<p>JavaScript operators allow us to perform tests, do math, join strings together, and other such things.</p>
<li>Conditionals</li>
<p>A conditional code block allows you to run code selectively, depending on whether a certain condition is true or not. It looks a bit like a function, but it isn't. The simplest form of conditional block starts with the keyword if, then some parentheses, then some curly braces. Inside the parentheses we include a test. If the test returns true, we run the code inside the curly braces. If not, we don't, and move on to the next bit of code.</p>
<script src="https://pastebin.com/embed_js/taWiHANv"></script>
<li>Events</li>
<p>Events are things that happen in the browser — a button being clicked, a page loading, a video playing, etc. — in response to which we can run blocks of code. The constructs that listen out for the event happening are called event listeners, and the blocks of code that run in response to the event firing are called event handlers.</p>
<li>Loops</li>
<p>Loops are a very important concept in programming, which allow you to keep running a piece of code over and over again, until a certain condition is met.</p>

<h3>What went wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript</h3>
<p>Types of error</p>
<p>Generally speaking, when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>
<p>Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through — you will usually be provided with some error messages too. These are usually okay to fix, as long as you are familiar with the right tools and know what the error messages mean!</p>
<p>Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs successfully but gives incorrect results. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.</p>
<div class="info">Note: console.log() is a really useful debugging function that prints a value to the console. So it will print the value of something to the console as soon as we have tried to set it in line x.</div>
